title: Ecological Networks in R
author_field: Miguel Lurgi and Sebastian Block
description: This course shows how to analize ecological networks in R, using `igraph`
  and `cheddar` packages. You should already know the basics of the R programming
  language (the introductory courses here in DataCamp should be enough). The course
  has a practical focus. If you want to study the theory of networks in more depth,
  give a look to the courses offered by Complexity Learning.
